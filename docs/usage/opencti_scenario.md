Creating a Scenario is not an easy task. To help you build meaningfull ones, directly related to threats meaningfull to you, you can leverage an OpenCTI platform integration.

When a Scenario is generated from OpenCTI, a Scenario is automatically created and can be consulted in the Scenarios screen. The name of the Scenario includes an OpencTI mention. The Scenario will automatically contains relevant injects sequences in accordance with the threat context from OpenCTI.

You will need to review it and may be customize it to ensure the Scenario fits your requirement, and also to select Targets for the Scenario's injects.

Once you are ready, schedule you Simulation(s), as for other Scenarios. Global results will also be available directly into OpenCTI, in the Overview of the threat context the Scenario is based on!
